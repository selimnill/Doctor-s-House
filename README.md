# Doctor-s-House is Treatment based Dynamic application. You can call this as a MERN Stack Web app. Because to created this website I used MongoDB, Express JS, React JS and Node JS.User have to create an account using email and password or googleSignIn method. A user can book his/her appointment for his desire future date. But the condition is a user can book not more than one appointment in specific treatment. If the booking complete then user can see details and process to payment in the dashboard. If the user deos not sign in or login they couldn't see dashboard option on the navbar. Anyway, User can payment their appointment fees using debit, credit, etc. There's also has an admin panel. An admin can manage user and make user to admin. Admin can add doctor's with some specific information and manage doctor's. The authenticationa and authorization system make with firebase. Payment System use with Stripe react js. Backend use languages are Express JS and Node JS. Overall Technology used are : HTMl, CSS, Tailwind CSS, React icons, React Js, Express JS, Node JS, MongoDB, Firebase, Stripe and Vercel.
